# Silent communication,when you don't have the desire or energy to speak verbally.

Sometimes there comes a time when you lack the energy or desire to respond verbally. You respond simply by showing images on the screen. This is exactly what the "Introvert Talk" app is designed for.

A simple swipe left or right (or long swipe) lets you choose between responses, while a swipe down or double-tap allows you to select images directly from the list. Swiping up will reveal the settings screen, where you can turn off the green or red background for some options.
